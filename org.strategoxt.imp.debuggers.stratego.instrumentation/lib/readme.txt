Stratego.dsldi.aterm is an ATerm representation of the Stratego.dsldi file.
The ATerm can be included in the Stratego code using import-term(lib/Stratego.dsldi.aterm).
This way we don't have to remember were we have put the .dsldi file.
A separate .dsldi is not needed because it will not change (once released).
